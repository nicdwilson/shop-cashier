# shop-cashier

Creates a `Shop cashier` user role, and limits the access of the Shop cashier to products in the category with the slug `offline`.

This allows a Woo mobile user to create an order for WooPayments In Person Payments without having to scroll through an extensive list of products which are not available in the physical shop, but are available on the site for online only purchase.

It speeds things up in order creation and checkout.
